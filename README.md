BitRAT has inbuilt hVNC/Hidden Desktop (can be purchased as separate module for only 299$) and is just as powerful as those sold on the market for thousands.
Don't waste your money on other hVNC/Hidden Desktop. BitRAT hVNC supports many browsers, like Chrome, FireFox, etc. with Webgl 100%.
I guarantee that BitRAT has at least just as good hVNC/Hidden Desktop, if not even better.

 If hVNC/Hidden Desktop is not enough then you also have a Hidden Browser feature (included for free).?

 

All licenses are lifetime! No need to worry about license system or take downs.
Our license server and everything else is behind a Tor hidden service.

 

BitRAT can generate clients to connect from Secure sockets/SSL or Tor.
You can also generate easily your own hidden service (.onion address) from the RAT that your client can connect to.
Hidden service is good when you need privacy and tired from using public DNS services that ban you.

 

XMR Miner use 64-bit version of XMRig and you can make easily 1000+ USD/month from 1k clients.

 

RAT has been tested and can easy hold 5k clients with ~2% CPU on modern i7, without any problems.

 

You will not be disappointed with BitRAT. I'm 100% confident BitRAT is future of RATS and you will love it.

 

 

Feature list

    Two modes of connections:
    Direct reverse connection mode via secure sockets (up to TLS 1.3)

    Tor connection:
    - Create a client that connects either straight to your own DNS/IP or:
    - Via a Tor hidden service (RAT can generate your private v3 .onion address in a few seconds with a single click for enhanced privacy from the settings)
    - By using the Tor hidden service method, you do not need to forward any ports.

 

    Native client coded in C/C++.
    Fully Unicode compatible.

   Downloader - Generate a downloader for any exe of your choice with options of execution from memory (RunPE) or disk.
    UAC Exploit for elevated privileges (Admin rights without UAC notice on Windows 10).

   Protect process. Impossible to kill process.

   Kill Windows Defender.
    Multi-mode, capable of handling both Tor and direct connected clients.
    On-Join/Connect tasks/Auto-commands
    Group view
    Thumbnail previews for either screen or webcam that you can move and place anywhere on your screen.
    Process manager
    Remote shell
    Connection manager
    Services manager
    Software manager
    Window manager
    Registry manager
    Firewall (IP blacklist from settings)

 

    Connection capacities:
    - Capable of managing well over 10 000 clients with a lag-free and relatively low CPU usage thanks to FastObjectListview.
    - 1000 clients on a Intel Core i7-6650U and 8 GB RAM result in an average of 1.5% CPU usage of the RAT.

 

    Binder:
    - Bind up to 5 files.
    - Select to execute from memory or disk.
    - Run-once option
    - Change icon of any executable file with ease.

 

    Remote browser:
    - Currently supported browsers: Chrome and All Windows versions starting from 8 and up.
    - High FPS cap with to 60 FPS.
    - Much better and faster than HVNC and HRDP!
    - Uses existing profile by default if Chrome is unused or creates a new one if in use.

 

    Password recovery:
    - Powerful recovery with support of over 30 browsers and over 500 applications in total, email clients, IMs, etc...
    No other RAT can recover more passwords.

 

    XMR Miner:
    - Utilizing XMRig
    - CPU: Hashing speed of up to 2000 H/s on a modern strong i7 processor.
    - GPU: Utilizes XMRig-CUDA whenever possible for even higher hash speed rate.
    - Advanced options include; select threads, algorithm, donation value, process priority and more.
    - 64-bit option for faster mining [Recommended].
    - Live statistics in a managed table of all mining clients with total hash rate.
    - Individual log view.

 

    Reverse proxy:
    - SOCKS4 mode
    - Very fast, stable and supports multi-tabbing without any problems (Open ports are required).
    - Full statistics include speed and traffic information.

    - Utilize SOCKS5 on your clients by attempting to automatically forward ports via UPnP.

 BitRAT can generate clients to connect from Secure sockets/SSL or Tor.
You can also generate easily your own hidden service (.onion address) from the RAT that your client can connect to.
Hidden service is good when you need privacy and tired from using public DNS services that ban you.

 

XMR Miner use 64-bit version of XMRig and you can make easily 800-900 USD/month from 1k clients.

RAT has been tested and can easy hold 5k clients with 2-5% CPU on modern i7, without any problems.
